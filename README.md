# Pig Game
Pig Game is a simple interactive dice game built using JavaScript as part of the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/): The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. This game involves rolling a dice and accumulating points, with the twist of avoiding a "pig-out" where you lose all points on a single roll.

The project is a great example of DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with random number generation to create a functional game in the browser.


## Features
- Roll Dice: Players roll two dice on each turn and accumulate points.
- Hold Button: Players can "hold" to add their accumulated points to their overall score.
- Game Over Condition: A player wins by reaching a set score (default: 100).
- Pig-out Rule: If a player rolls a 1 on either dice, they lose all points for that turn.
- Reset Game: Restart the game at any time to play again.
